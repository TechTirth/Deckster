# Deckster

A React card UI project built with Vite, custom CSS, and a mock API.

---

## Steps Involved

1. **Created a new React project using Vite**

   Scaffolded the project for fast development and modern tooling.

2. **Added the project to a GitHub repository**

   Used git for version control and collaboration.

3. **Styled the app using custom CSS**

   All components and layouts use hand-written CSS for a unique look.

4. **Set up a mock API with json-server**

   Created a `db.json` file in the project root to store sample card data.

5. **Started the mock API server**

   - Ran `npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001`
   - The API is available at [http://localhost:3001/cards](http://localhost:3001/cards)
   - Supports GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT/PATCH out of the box

6. **Connected the React app to the mock API**

   - Fetched card data from the API and displayed it in the UI.
   - Added functionality to add and delete cards, updating both the UI and the database.
